-- PostgreSQL initialization script
-- This script will be executed when the container starts for the first time

-- The database 'tangy_mango' is already created by the POSTGRES_DB environment variable
-- We can add any additional setup here if needed

-- Create indexes that would be useful for the application
-- These will be created after migrations run, but we can prepare the database

-- Optional: Create additional users or set up specific permissions
-- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE tangy_mango TO postgres;

-- You can add more initialization SQL here if needed
